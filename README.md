# NotesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

This was my first attempt to create an Angular based application. It depicts the frontend part only.

##Functions
It can do simple CRUD operation like we can create a new Memo/Note/To-Do and write a short description about it. Once created it will take back to the page where all the Notes are stored together.
If in future the Note needs to be updated and changed, it can be done so.
Once the Task is completed, we can delete the Memo for good.

##Styles
Sass styles is used with the help of Bulma framework to make the look and feel of the app better
